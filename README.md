JavaScript Calculator

A simple, responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation and event handling to create an interactive user interface. It includes basic arithmetic functions as well as advanced features such as trigonometric calculations, square roots, percentages, and exponents.
Features

    Basic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    Scientific operations: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (log, ln), square roots, and powers
    Custom functions: Percentages handling
    User-friendly interface: Buttons dynamically update the display, with input validation and error handling

Technical Details

    DOM Manipulation: Each button on the calculator uses event listeners to update the display in real-time, capturing user input and performing operations based on button clicks.
    Event Handling: JavaScript functions handle button clicks and execute calculations, ensuring smooth transitions between different operations.
    Regular Expressions: Used to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions (e.g., handling exponents and trigonometric functions).
    CSS Styling: Designed with a clean and responsive layout for ease of use across different devices.
